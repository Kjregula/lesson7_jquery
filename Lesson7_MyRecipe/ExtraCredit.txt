I took examples from both the first and second javascript examples in order to provide an App that is simplistic yet provides information when wanted instead of clogging up the screen. For both the ingredients and instructions, when hovered they are highlighted yellow and fade in the details for each. When not hovered over, the background color of the text is switched to white and the picture is the main eyepiece.
